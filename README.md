This report analyzes the air quality of the west coast states (Washington, Oregon, and California) from 2020 to 2022. Using data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we plotted the Air Quality Indexes (AQI) using the categories "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy", "Unhealthy for Sensitve Groups", "Very Unhealthy", and "Hazardous". We sought to compare and contrast the air quality across the three years, between the states, and find how often residence of these areas were exposed to "Unhealthy" or "Hazardous" air. We considered both the human and environmental implications and impacts of air quality and its relationship to an overall picture of Climate Change. 

The results showed that Washington state consistently had the highest number of "Good" days, then Oregon, and then California with the least amount. The most change was seen in California where the number of "Good" days decreased and the number of "Moderate" days increased. Each year, all states had 1-3 "Hazardous" days. Even though this is a minimal number, it is still cause for concern that specific days even reached this level. We believe that social awareness and education is the first step of protecting people and inpsiring change in our actions in the name of the environment. Our data seeks to provide a clear representation that is easy to read and understand for the everyday resident.
